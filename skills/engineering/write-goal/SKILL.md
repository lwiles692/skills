# Write a good goal (write-goal)

Help the user turn a rough intention into an objective that an agent's persistent goal workflow can pursue across many turns without supervision. A goal is not a task description — it is a completion contract. It says what must become *true*, how that truth is *proven*, where the work may and may not *reach*, and when to *stop and report* instead of grinding on.

This skill is about authoring the objective text together with the user. Drafting and starting are separate steps. Settle the wording first. Start the goal only when the user explicitly asks and the host provides a goal-start capability.

## Adapt to the host

Detect the capabilities available in the current host. Treat tool names, parameters, confirmation behavior, budget units, and active-goal rules as host-specific. Use only capabilities and fields that the host exposes. If the host cannot start a persistent goal, return the approved objective and explain that limitation instead of inventing a command or parameter.

## Use structured choices

Use the host's structured-choice capability for every decision that has a finite set of options. Do not assume a specific tool name. Batch related choices in one prompt when that helps the user decide.

Goal authoring includes choices about scope, phrasing, budgets, and permission modes. When the current mode or host does not provide a structured-choice prompt, ask one short plain-text question with clearly labeled options and wait for the user's answer. Do not bury discrete options in a paragraph.

Ask open-ended questions, such as "What would prove this is done?", in plain text.

## Rules of engagement

- **Only help when the user has asked for it.** Never volunteer to wrap an ordinary request in a goal, and never start one on your own. A normal "fix this test" is a normal request; treat it as a goal only when the user says they want a persistent goal. If a task looks suitable for a persistent goal workflow, you may mention that once — but wait for the user to choose.
- **Write in the user's language.** Draft the objective in whatever language the user is writing to you in. If the project configuration or a saved memory names a preferred language, honor that instead. Keep the surrounding discussion in the same language.
- **Show before you start.** Always present the full drafted goal back to the user and get their agreement before anything runs. The user should read the exact text that will become the objective, not a paraphrase of it.
- **Draft with the user, not for them.** Goal-writing is a conversation. Offer a draft, explain the choices you made, invite changes, and fold the feedback in. Expect more than one round.
- **Respect the user's final call.** If, after you have pointed out what is vague or risky, the user still wants a looser or thinner goal, write the goal they asked for. Note the trade-off once; do not keep relitigating it or quietly "improve" the wording against their wishes.

## What makes a goal good

The strongest goals share one shape: they define **proof, not effort**. "Keep improving the code" describes effort and never ends. "Done when `npm test` exits 0 and no file outside `src/auth` changed" describes proof and is checkable. Aim for a contract with these parts:

1. **End state** — the condition that must become true. Name the finish line concretely: a passing suite, an empty queue, a search that returns zero matches, a deployed artifact.
2. **Proof** — the observable evidence that the end state holds. Prefer things the agent can run and you can inspect afterward: a command's exit code, a test count, a `grep`/`rg` with no hits, a file that now exists, a metric over a threshold.
3. **Boundaries** — what the work may and may not touch. Name the scope (which module, which directory) and the off-limits actions (do not edit the spec, do not change unrelated files, do not make destructive data changes).
4. **The loop** — when the work is iterative, say how to iterate: rerun the check after each change, work through the queue item by item, replay the failing cases until they pass.
5. **The stop rule** — how to end honestly when "done" is not reachable. A "stop and ask before widening scope" clause and an explicit blocked path ("if an external service is down, record it and move on") let the agent report instead of faking a pass or looping forever. This is about *honesty*, not a spending limit — keep it separate from any budget (see below).

Two habits make almost any goal better:

- **Make it queue-shaped.** Goals that shrink a list work best: failing tests, open issues, error traces, files to migrate, rows to process. A queue gives the agent a worklist and gives you a countable definition of done.
- **Lean on existing verification.** Tests, CI, type-checks, lint, eval suites, browser audits, and zero-match searches are leverage — they are what let a goal run unattended and still be trusted. If a task has no way to prove completion, help the user add one or reconsider whether a persistent goal workflow fits.

Longer runs are not better runs. A tight contract that finishes in a handful of turns beats an open-ended one that burns hours re-running the whole suite after every edit.

## Budgets are opt-in

Some hosts support turn, token, cost, or other budgets. Treat budgets as optional host capabilities. **Do not set a budget by default, and never bake an arbitrary cap into the objective text.** A well-specified goal already stops on its own — when the proof passes or a blocker is hit — so an arbitrary cap usually does nothing except risk cutting off work midway.

When a budget is genuinely useful — typically an open-ended or exploratory goal that could run long unattended — you may suggest one in a unit that the host supports and the user can evaluate. Let the user choose the value, and check whether it fits the work. If the requested value looks oversized, say so and offer a smaller one, but respect their final call. If the host does not support budgets, do not emulate one by adding an arbitrary cap to the objective.

## Workflow

1. **Understand the intention.** Ask what outcome the user actually wants and what would prove it is done. If a finish line or a check is missing, that gap is the first thing to resolve together. As soon as the open questions reduce to concrete options, use the structured-choice approach described earlier.
2. **Draft the goal.** Write a concrete objective in the user's language, covering as many parts of the contract above as the task warrants. Keep it readable — one or a few sentences for simple work, a short structured block (end state, checks, boundaries, stop rule) for larger work.
3. **Show it and explain.** Present the draft in full and walk through the choices: what you picked as the finish line, what proves it, what you fenced off, when it stops. Point out anything still soft.
4. **Revise together.** Take the user's edits and produce a new draft. When you are weighing alternative phrasings or scopes, offer them through the structured-choice approach described earlier. Repeat until they are satisfied. If they want it looser than you would recommend, say so once, then write their version.
5. **Start it when requested.** After the user approves the wording, ask whether they want to start the goal. If they explicitly agree and the host provides a goal-start capability, invoke it with the agreed objective and only the optional fields that the host supports. Otherwise, return the exact objective for the user to use. Never assume that the host provides another confirmation step.

## A reusable shape

For a non-trivial goal, this fill-in-the-blanks structure covers the contract:

```
<What must become true.>
Done when <command/search/state that proves it>.
Scope: only <files/area>; do not <off-limits action>.
Loop: <how to iterate — rerun the check after each change, etc.>.
If <blocking condition>, stop and report instead of forcing a pass.
```

Not every goal needs every line, and none of them is an execution cap — the goal stops when the proof passes or a blocker is hit. A small, well-scoped task can be a single clear sentence. Add structure as the work grows or the cost of a wrong autonomous run rises.

## Weak to strong

- Weak: `Find all bugs in this codebase.` — no finish line, no proof, no stop. The agent may block at once or run far past what you wanted.
  Strong: `Fix every test in test/auth that currently fails, rerun npm test until it exits 0, change no file outside test/ or src/auth, and report anything you cannot fix with its location and why.`
- Weak: `Optimize the project.` — no scope, no measure.
  Strong: `Migrate the payment module to the new API, make npm test -- payment exit 0, keep the diff limited to payment-related files, and stop and ask before touching shared infrastructure.`
- Weak: `Make it faster.`
  Strong: `Make renderFrame at least 3x faster measured by the bench/render benchmark; if you cannot reach 3x after several attempts, report the best result and why.`

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Better |
| --- | --- |
| Starting or suggesting a goal the user did not ask for | Only draft a goal once the user asks; mention the option at most once otherwise |
| Drafting in English when the user is writing in another language | Match the user's language (or the project / memory preference) |
| Running the goal before the user has seen the exact text | Show the full draft and get agreement first |
| Polishing the goal silently against the user's stated wishes | Note the trade-off once, then write the goal they asked for |
| Burying a discrete choice in prose | Use a structured-choice prompt, or clearly labeled plain-text options when one is unavailable |
| Specifying effort ("keep improving X") | Specify proof ("done when check X passes") |
| Baking an execution cap into the objective or setting a budget unprompted | Let the goal stop on its proof; suggest only a useful budget that the host supports |
| No blocked path | Add an explicit "stop and report" rule for blockers |
| A goal with no way to verify completion | Anchor it to tests, a search, a metric, or another inspectable check |
